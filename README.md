# Memory Card Flip Game - Created by OpenAI Assistant

## Overview

This memory card flip game was created entirely by OpenAI's Assistant, showcasing the power
of [the current state of the art in] AI-driven development. With just nine lines of prompting provided in `main.py`, the
Assistant generated a complete, playable game tailored for toddlers.

## How It Was Made

The `main.py` script uses OpenAI's API to send a prompt to the Assistant, which then returns a fully functional
HTML/JavaScript game. This process demonstrates the Assistant's ability to understand complex tasks and produce
ready-to-use code. It's mostly boilerplate; the prompt serves as the technical/product requirements everything
else is a simple wrapper around OpenAI's Assistants API.

## Running the Game

The game is generated and written to `index.html` by running `main.py`. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and
permissions set up for OpenAI's services.

NB: Game generation is not deterministic. This version of `index.html` was created in one shot, but if your
generated `index.html` isn't to your liking, just run `main.py` again until you get a version you like.
